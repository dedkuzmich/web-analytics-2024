Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion.

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece.

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

(The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""

redglassbird,2023-11-07 07:13:19,https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/redglassbird/733312397281984512,,Okay okay fine Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll tell you guys about my personal life.So. (The vibe is that weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover pretend weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at a sleepover) it all started with this fateful edit of Josh Hutcherson that I saw. Immediately sent it to my friends and guess what. Now my entire feed is filled with FNAF lore.Yea itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a slippery slope guys. (Plato Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure you wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve loved this story and all its philosophical elements). Well now Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m ina vicious FNAF cycle despite not ever being remotely interested in FNAF lore. But also. I am always curious. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s something about me Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m always curious. so I always click on the posts and they just keep coming in an inescapable avalanche.Well. when I am tired my brain also likes to self sabotage and make me spooked w things that would not normally scare me. Anyways Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m trying to sleep the other night right. And I nee does my brain manifest? Animatronics in my closet. Which. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fine. Whatever. Brains gotta have fun sometimes I guess.Anyways I take a melatonin for the first time in weeks to knock me out . I have a vivid melatonin dream where I am a poor beggar trying to get water from an Italian restaurant but they keep kicking me out.( I still remember the face of the manager who was mean to me btw even tho I remember no other faces).Well one of the employees takes a liking to me and stands up for me and then naturally we start dating. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s me and Italian restaurant employee against the world (he is also rich somehow and his brother keeps having heart attacks which is also a central keystone to the dream but we wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t delve into that).A wandering narrative perhaps. but very emblematic of my life. Not the FNAF and Josh Hutcherson parts. Mostly the parts about melatonin dreams gaslighting me to oblivion. (Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m scared to tag this FNAF bc I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want Tumblr to get any ideas and thinkFNAF lore other than my own. But the things I do. The things I do for. Well I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know wha

Only times Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been able to listen to podcasts is when Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m stuck in the car (only as a passenger, canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t listen if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m the one driving) or back when I worked for my aunt packaging first aide kits.I am a crochet advocate. So many free tutorials on YouTube and it was pretty easy for me to pick up. Once you know the basics and have made a few things itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pretty easy to think up your own simple designs too. For example one of my first projects was a cardigan that I made from a free pattern and it was so easy. It was rly just make a ton of squares and stitch them together. Now, I have never knit so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know if itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easier or more fun, but I can advocate for crocheting at least. Only thing is yarn has gotten pretty expensive, which is annoying :/Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve heardality has gone down and prices have gone upIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d really like to get into either knit or crochet but one of the reasons Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been hesitant (aside from the general feeling that starting a new hobby is super daunting) is that I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know anything about yarn quality and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m afraid of getting ripped off But I do think it would be really fun to have a hobby where I make something so I should buckle do"
"the nice thing is that if you have a craft store near you the yarn goes on sale from time to time. I kinda have clocked when my local craft stores do that and only buy sale yarn. Now online is a different matter, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve never bought yarn online so thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s like the wild West to meI would say if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re starting off, acrylic yarn is cheap even though it feels less nice. I would make your first projects in that and then maybe as you get better switch to other materials that might be slightly more expensive.Anyways. Definitely something to look into, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m biased but I really think itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worth it. I struggle with feeling like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not doing enough if I sit down to listen to a podcast, but if Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m crocheting I feel immediately more productive.I will say, if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re into making clothes, making a crochet piece is often more expensive than say thrifting a piece. But if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re making something personalized that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll wear often that wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t guse out of it and keep it way longer. Just some more disordered thoughts bc I love talking about hobbies. But anyway if you crochet or knit something you should definitely keep the mutuals posted and post a pic on here <3"""
